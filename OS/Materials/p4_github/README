Project 4a:
1) server.c
  Creates threads dynamically and initializes the basic structure required depending
  on the number of threads and the buffer size initialized.
  Also hosts functions for producer and consumer and also contains function to get
  information of the file that is size of the file and the length of the filename.
  Uses the mutex locks and condition signals provided by the POSIX.
2) cs537.c
  Added few functions including put() and get() that are required by the producer-
  consumer relation to work.
3) request.c 
  Slightly modified the existing functions in order to be compatible with the 
  modifications in the cs537.c
  

Project 4b:
1)New system calls:
  clone:    Used for creating threads.
  join:     Used for joining threads.
  sleepcv:  Used by condition variables during cv_wait.
  wakecv:   Used by condition variables during cv_signal.
  For each of these 4 systems calls, kernel/sysproc. and kernel.proc 
  has a pair of functions that expose the functionality to 
  thread library in user programs.
2)New functions in ulib.c:
  Locks:            lock_init, lock_acquire, lock_release
  Threads:          thread_create, thread_join
  Cond. Variables:  cv_wait, cv_signal
