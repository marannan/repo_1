<h2>WARNING</h2> 

<p>This project is more difficult and more time consuming than the
  other projects you have done so far in CS 537.  Start early!</p> 

<h2>Important Dates</h2> 

<p><b>Questions about the project?</b> Send them to <code>537-help@cs.wisc.edu</code> .</p> 

<p><b>Due:</b> Wednesday 11/18 by 9pm.</p> 

<h2>Overview</h2> 

<p>There are two parts to this project:
</p><ul>
<li><a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dusseau/Classes/CS537/Fall2015/Projects/p4a.html">Scalable Web Server:</a> to be done on the linux lab,
so you can learn more about programming in C on a typical UNIX-based
  platform.  Before you begin, we highly recommend that
you watch this
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVihVzqTBUI">video</a> from a
  previous discussion section.  As was the case in the past, the
  project details will be slightly different, but the main ideas will
  be the same.
</li> 

<li><a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dusseau/Classes/CS537/Fall2015/Projects/p4b.html">Kernel Threads:</a> to be done in our xv6 hacking
  environment.  This is the
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9nW9UbkT7s">video</a> to
  watch for this part.</li> 

</ul> 
<p></p> 

<p>Click on the above links to learn more about what you should do. READ EACH CAREFULLY!</p> 

<h2>Notes</h2> 

<p><b>This project can be done with a single partner.</b> Copying code (from
other groups) is considered cheating. Read <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dusseau/Classes/CS537/Fall2015/dontcheat.html">this</a> for
more info on what is OK and what is not!

</p><h2>Handing It In</h2> 

<p>The handin directory is <code>~cs537-1/handin/SECTION/login/p4</code> where <code>
login</code> is your login and <code>SECTION</code> is your unofficial
  discussion
  section (e.g, 301).</p> 

<p>For the C/Linux part of this project, you should copy whatever
is needed to build the web server (including a makefile) into the <code>
linux/</code> subdirectory.</p> 

<p>For the xv6 part of the project, copy all of your source files (but not .o
files, please, or binaries!) into the <code>xv6/</code> subdirectory of your p4
directory. A simple way to do this is to copy everything into the destination
directory directory, then type <code>make</code> to make sure it builds, and then
type <code>make clean</code> to remove unneeded files.</p> 

<p>Finally, into your p4 directory, please include a README file. In there,
describe what you did a little bit.  The most important bit, at the top,
should be the authorship of the project, particularly if you had a
partner. Include both partner's names and CS logins to receive credit; please
put the README in BOTH partners' directories; put the code in just
  one.  <b>Do not put any code in the other person's handin directory!</b></p>
