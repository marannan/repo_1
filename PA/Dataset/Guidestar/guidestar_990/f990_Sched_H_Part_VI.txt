thousands of additional tourists visit the island annually It is reported that as many as 2.5 million people visit Acadia National Park on Mount Desert Island annually, amny of whom will reside on island during their visit This population swelling results in a significant increase in medical services provided by Mount Desert Island Hospital and its health centers located throughout the

live and work on the Island, it also ensures that MDI Hospital maintain its uniquely personal connection and intimacy to the communities it serves Medical staff privileges are extended to all qualified physicians in the community As MDI Hospital is located on an Island, additional specialty services are made available on the island, by medical staff from the mainland, thus providing many specialty services which would otherwise be unavailable in the community Patients would still have access to these specialities, they would have to travel off the island to other communities or cities to receive these services The organization applies surplus funds to patient care improvements through its capital expenditure program, employee and medical staff education, community benefits programs, to remain viable and technologically current Advocacy initiatives for promoting community wide, state, or national efforts work to improve health of the population and increase

IRS 990H Instructions/Guidance provide a template (Worksheet 2 Template) as a way to determine the overall cost to charge ratio that could be applied throughout the IRS 990H form in order to convert charges to cost Where applicable, we have utilized the worksheet 2 template calculation The only areas we did not utilize this template calculation were the following A IRS 990H worksheet 6-Subsidized Health Services- (The supporting schedule for Part I, Line 7G) we did not utilize the worksheet 2 percentage when we were determining the profit/loss of each of our provider based clinics In addition, when we were compiling the subsidized provider based clinics listed in 1C above, we utilized the actual estimated costs on the modified Medicare cost report we prepared instead of applying the worksheet 2 cost to charge percentage B IRS 990H Worksheet 3- Unreimbursed Medicaid and other means tested government programs (the supporting schedule for Part I, Lines 7B and 7C) and worksheet 6

Trustees sets the strategic direction for the hospital and is comprised of community members from the hospital's service area This group is made up of local business owners, professionals and retirees Maine Coast's non-profit status allows the hospital to reinvest any excess of revenues over expense back into the hospital to continuously improve the medical care it delivers The hospital allows

a community benefit (i e, aggregate loss or subsidy from the hospital) of approximately $5.3 million This community benefit does not include any hospital overhead allocated to these clinics In addition, the community benefit also does not take into account bad debts, charity care and contractual adjustment Thus this community benefit of approximately $5.3 million is a conservative figure

a variety of critical target areas including community health education, access to primary care, care for chronic conditions, geriatric care, and mental health and substance abuse As a follow up to the studies conducted in 2001 and 2007, EMHS contracted with the Centerfor Health Policy, Planning and Research (CHPPR) at the University of New England (led by Ron Deprez, PhD MPH) to determine changes in health status and barriers to care since 2001 The 2007 Community Health Needs Assessment was funded again as a community service of EMHS Foundation, the philanthropic center of EMHS EMHS participated in another Community Health Needs assessment in late 2010 Those results were made available in 2011,and in late June of 2011, EMMC,as a member of EMHS, hosted a community health needs assessment forum at the Spectacular Event Center in Bangor so community leaders and public health officials could discuss a collaborative effort to best address the needs of residents in Penobscot County EMMC also had representatives at several other community forums since we serve as the leading tertiary referral center for the northern two-thirds of the state In 2013, we continued the implementation of the strategies developed in that process"|"Financial assistance or free care is available only for medically necessary services Posters are displayed in patient care areas, information and forms are available online on the hospital website, and patient billing representatives are also available to answer questions and take calls"|"EMMC is a comprehensive, 411-bed medical center serving the greater Bangor area and the northern two thirds of Maine The medical center and its medical staff of more than 400 physicians provide three-quarters of the primary-care hospital services offered in the Bangor area, as well as specialty and intensive services for patients from Waterville to the Canadian border EMMC also provides outreach clinics to many local hospitals in the region, allowing easier access for patients and supporting the role of those hospitals in their communities EMMC is an American College of Surgeons verified Level II trauma center, bariatric center, community cancer center and host of Lifeflight of Maine, a statewide medical helicopter service that transports critically ill and injured patients EMMC is also a Joint Commission certified Joint Center and Stroke Center In the Community Health Needs Assessment for EMHS, it states 1) Penobscot County has the highest percentage of females in any county with no medical checkup in the past two years2) Penobscot County has the highest percentage of obese residents of any county3) Penobscot County has a low percentage of males 50+ who've received a prostate exam within the past two years"|""|""|"Using the data in the EMHS Community Health Needs Assessment, EMMC collaborates with other EMHS hospitals and with others in the community on solutions to some of most significant healthcare problems such as overcoming barriers accessing to care, healthcare provider shortages, and obesity EMMC is reaching out to providers across the region to formulate strategies for better patient access to care, including improved scheduling, aggressive recruiting of physicians, and enhanced communication regarding care transitions With the help of technology, such as tele-trauma, specialists at our hospital are able to assist with traumas and specialized clinical cases at other hospitals using high resolution, remote cameras and communication equipment With a shortage of healthcare providers in rural areas of Maine, investments such as this are sharing specialty level medical and surgical resources with rural communities, maximizing our region's ability to respond to medical needs and, when appropriate, supporting patient care closer to home"|""|"Part II, line 4 - Community Building ActivitiesThrough public health screenings, professional and community education, and charity care, EMMC, as a member of EMHS system, works hard to make a difference in our community These community benefits reflect EMMC's nonprofit mission Eastern Maine Medical Center demonstrated its ongoing commitment to improving the health status of Maines workforce by renewing its regional sponsorship of the Wellness Council of Maine Largely as a result of the work of this group, our region was designated as the nation's first ""Well Region"" with many employers qualifying as ""Well Workplaces"" under the Wellness Councils of A merica criteria Having earned, for the second time, the Wellness Councils of A mericas Platinum Well Workplace Award (Welcoa's highest honor), EMMC is investing both inside its own walls and outside to promote healthy choices, healthy lifestyles, and lower healthcare costs For FY2013, EMMC delivered a total community benefit of more than $107 8 million ME EMMC's Wellness Services offers a wide variety of health and wellness programs designed to
