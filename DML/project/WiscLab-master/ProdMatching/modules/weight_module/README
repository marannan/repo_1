Description:

This module comapares the weights of two given products and returns a value which indicates if the products have identical weights or not. 
Using a regular expression, the weights are extracted from the given product description and compared. Both the numerical value and measurement unit (lbs,kgs,grams,tons etc.) are compared individually and the match is identified. 

If the products do not match in weight, a list [0,1] is returned. ( where 0 indicates that product weights do not match, 1 - confidence score)
If the products match in weight, a list [1,1] is returned. ( where 1 indicates that product weights match, 1 - confidence score)  
If the weights of one or both the products are missing in the product description, a list [-1,1] is returned. (where -1 indicates cannot predict match/no match, 1 -confidence score)

To use the module:

Install using setup.py
