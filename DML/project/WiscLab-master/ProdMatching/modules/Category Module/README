Category Module for Laptop Cases

The module does the following operations:

Given JSON description of 2 products, it first checks to see if both are laptop cases.
    - If they are not laptop cases, program returns 0 with confidence 1.0.
    - If the program is not sure, it returns -1 with confidence 1.0.

    If both the products are indeed laptop cases,
        - It checks if both are referring to the same product.
            - If it is sure that both the products are same, it returns 1 with confidence 1.0.
            - If its not sure, it returns -1 with confidence 1.0.
            - If they are not the same product, it returns 0 with confidence 1.0.


Instructions to run:

Method #1
# Copy the package to the project directory
# Import the function is_same_laptop_case from laptop_case_product_matching as follows:
    from laptop_case_product_matching import is_same_laptop_case

    [a, b] = is_same_laptop_case(product1_json, product2_json)

    Input: product1_json, product2_json
     product1_json - JSON describing first product
     product2_json - JSON describing second product

    Output:[a, b]
