Goal:
We're going to attack the unsecured version of the strcpy which copies to 240 without bounds checking.
And get access to sh with root access

Idea: 
We need to overflow the buffer and overwrite the eip and point it somewhere in the buffer region thats copied by strcpy. 


Steps:
1) Make the attack buffer and send over to strcpy with following recepie.
2) Add noon sled as a safe landing point for modified eip. Can be found by trail and error. 
3) Add shellcode from alephone.
4) Add the address (4 bytes) of landing point to be overwritten in the place of eip. 
   It can be found by knowing the esp/ebp of function where strpcy is present to figure out buffer's address.
