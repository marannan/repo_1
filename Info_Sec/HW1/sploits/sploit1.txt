Goal:
We're going to attack the unsecured version of the strcpy in target1 which copies to 240 without bounds checking.
With the attack, we'll get access to sh with root access

Idea: 
We need to overflow the buffer and overwrite the EIP and point it somewhere in the buffer region where our shellcode is  copied.


Steps:
1) Make the attack buffer and send over to strcpy with following recepie.
2) Add noop sled as a safe landing point for modified EIP. This can be found by trail and error. 
3) Add shellcode from alephone.
4) Add the address (4 bytes) of landing point to be overwritten in the place of EIP. 
It can be found by knowing the ESP/EBP of bar() buffer is allocated to figure out buffer region address.
